# Mekhane source code

This is the (almost) full source code of the Mekhane bot in JavaScript, to help people learn to make some functions in this bot. Comments aren't fully detailed yet, I might fix this in the future.

Tokens are obviously not included for security reasons.

I know it's unoptimized, I'm too scared to move around old code that I made several months ago and have no memory of making it or how it's supposed to work. If you want to help, I'd be more than happy to hear it
